# text-game

A simple text game that allows you to move around in a 20 x 20 grid. You can interact with items and monsters.

## What The Code Is Trying To Do

My project's code is trying to replicate the feeling of javax.swing but with text rather than a gui. During gameplay, you can explore your map and interact with items and monsters.
